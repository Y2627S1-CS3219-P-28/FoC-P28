# user-service

Owner: Oh Yi Xian

The user account and role service for FoC. It stores application-level user
profiles and roles in MongoDB, while Firebase Authentication remains responsible
for authentication and email/password credentials.
Spring Boot 4.1.1 on Java 21 with MongoDB.
It follows the repo conventions in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

- **API:** `/api/users`
- **Health:** `/actuator/health` (with readiness and liveness groups)

## Run

```bash
# Whole system through the gateway at http://localhost:8080
docker compose up --build

# Service from source against the emulators
docker compose up -d firebase-emulator
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster.mongodb.net/UserServiceDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority" \
PORT=8081 ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- OpenAPI JSON: `/api/users/v3/api-docs`
- Health: `/actuator/health`

## Admin Bootstrap Creation

### Local
When running locally, follow the steps below to create the first admin account:
1. Start up the app with `docker compose up --build`
2. Access the Firebase Auth Emulator at `localhost:4000`
3. Go to the `Authentication` tab and click `Add user`
4. Enter the email of your desired bootstrap admin user (e.g. admin@u.nus.edu), set email to verified and enter a password that is at least 8 characters long, with a number and special character
5. Save the user
6. Duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env
7. Ensure the `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=true` is set to true. `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=admin@u.nus.edu`and change the email after the `=` character to the email you set in the Firebase Emulator
8. Restart the user service with `docker compose up -d --force-recreate user-service`
9. The admin account is created and you can log in with it on `localhost:8080`. No need to create/sign up with the email.
10. You can now set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=false` or remove it entirely from the .env file.

### Cloud
When running locally, follow the steps below to create the first admin account:
1. Access the online Firebase Console for the project
2. Go to the `Authentication` tab and click `Add user`
3. Enter the email of your desired bootstrap admin user (e.g. admin@u.nus.edu) and enter a password that is at least 8 characters long, with a number and special character
5. Save the user
6. Open the Google Cloud Console of the project and open the user-service container
7. Open the `Containers` tab
7. Add a new variable named `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED` with value `true` `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL` with value `admin@u.nus.edu`. The value is the email you set in the Firebase console.
8. Select `View diff & redeploy`. Deploy the changes.
9. The admin account is created. Attempt to sign in with it and request an email verification. No need to create/sign up with the email.
10. After verifying the email, you can sign in with the admin account. 
11. You can now set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED` to `false` or remove it entirely from the user-service variables.

## Sprint 3 API

Authenticated endpoints use:
`Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>`
The Firebase ID token identifies the caller. The User Service uses the Firebase
UID from the verified token rather than trusting a UID supplied by the client
when retrieving the current user's profile.

Creating a user commits a `UserCreated` outbox event in the same MongoDB transaction. The outbox
publisher sends schema version 1 to the environment's `USER_CREATED_TOPIC`; Credit Service consumes
the event asynchronously and idempotently allocates the initial 50-credit account. Registration no
longer calls Credit Service synchronously, so a temporary Credit outage leaves the event pending for retry.
