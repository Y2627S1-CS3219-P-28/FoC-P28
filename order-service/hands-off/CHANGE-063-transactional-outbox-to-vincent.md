# Order Service Handoff to Vincent: Transactional Event Delivery

- **Prepared by:** Yao Xiang (Developer 1)
- **For:** Vincent (Developer 2)
- **Date:** 2026-10-03
- **Branch:** `order-service/sprint-1/yx-seq1-to-seq11`
- **Change:** [CHANGE-063](../changes/CHANGE-063-transactional-outbox.md)
- **Decision:** [ADR-013](../docs/decisions/ADR-013-transactional-outbox.md)

> **Superseded for accepted-cancellation behavior:** [CHANGE-064](../changes/CHANGE-064-accepted-cancellation-reopen-or-event.md) / [ADR-014](../docs/decisions/ADR-014-accepted-cancellation-hybrid-flow.md) now require synchronous Credit hold then direct `ACCEPTED -> OPEN` before expiry, and the cancellation event only at/after expiry. The following handoff records the original CHANGE-063 milestone; use CHANGE-064 and the updated Sequence 7 for current behavior.

## What is implemented

Completion and cancellation outcome events now use a transactional outbox. For each supported transition, Order Service writes the resulting Order, checkpoint, command receipt, and serialized full-Order event into PostgreSQL in the same transaction. A database rollback removes both the state change and its event intent.

After commit, an `AFTER_COMMIT` listener immediately asks the dispatcher to publish the event through its matching typed publisher. The listener runs before the transactional service call returns, so the HTTP request waits for the publish attempt and Pub/Sub acknowledgment (or recorded failure), but never for a Credit or User consumer reply. A publish failure does not reverse the committed Order transition; it is logged and the outbox row is retried.

The Spring cron scheduler is a recovery path for pending events and expired leases. Dispatch claims rows with PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and a two-minute lease. Retries use bounded exponential delay up to five minutes. Stable event IDs are derived from event type and command ID. Delivery is at least once: consumers must deduplicate because a process can fail after Pub/Sub accepts a message but before Order Service records it as published.

The implemented event cases are:

- **Completion:** every successful completion emits one `OrderCompletionTaskEvent`, whether on time or overdue. It carries the full resulting Order snapshot plus `overdue` and `overdueAt` facts. Credit and User consumers are assumed future work.
- **OPEN cancellation:** requester cancellation emits `OpenOrderCancellationTaskEvent`; Credit is the assumed future consumer.
- **Accepted-order cancellation at CHANGE-063 time:** the assigned courier transitioned the order to `ABORTED` and emitted `AcceptedOrderCancellationTaskEvent`; this rule is superseded by CHANGE-064.

No separate overdue-completion event exists. Existing HTTP endpoint contracts are unchanged. Expiry/repost events and peer consumer implementations are outside this change.

## Main implementation locations

- Transition orchestration and event snapshot creation: `src/main/java/sg/edu/nus/foc/order/application/OrderTransitionService.java` and `OrderTaskEventFactory.java`.
- Outbox lifecycle and scheduling: `OrderOutboxDispatchRequested.java`, `OrderOutboxAfterCommitListener.java`, `OrderOutboxDispatcher.java`, and `OrderOutboxScheduler.java` under `application/`.
- Persistence boundary: `domain/OrderEventOutbox.java`, `domain/OutboxState.java`, `domain/repository/OrderEventOutboxRepository.java`, `infrastructure/OrderEventOutboxPersistenceAdapter.java`, and `JpaOrderEventOutboxRepository.java`.
- Schema: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__create_order_event_outbox.sql`. Flyway applies V2 at service startup; Hibernate validates the resulting schema.
- Configuration: `order.messaging.outbox.recovery-cron` defaults to once per minute; batch size defaults to 50.
- Design diagrams: `sprints/sprint-1/sequence-diagrams/updated-overall/sequence-5-complete-order.md`, `sequence-6-cancel-open-order.md`, `sequence-7-cancel-accepted-order.md`, and `sprints/sprint-1/class-diagrams/updated-overall/publisher-class-diagram.md`.

## Verification completed

The full Order Service command passed:

```text
mvn -B -ntp '-Dmaven.repo.local=target/m2-repository' verify
Tests run: 102, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
BUILD SUCCESS
All JaCoCo line and branch coverage checks met.
```

Testcontainers/PostgreSQL checks covered fresh Flyway migration, upgrade from V1 to V2, Hibernate schema validation, lease-based row claims, persisted retry/published states, and atomic rollback of the Order and outbox intent. `git diff --check` passed.

This verifies the Order-side code and persistence behavior. It does not verify live Pub/Sub delivery to Credit or User consumers, because those consumer implementations were not changed or exercised here.

## Follow-up and operating caveats

1. Review CHANGE-063, ADR-013, and the updated Sequence 5–7/class diagrams before changing event contracts or ordering.
2. Keep consumer work in the owning peer services. Consumers should deduplicate using `eventId`; do not treat Pub/Sub delivery as exactly once.
3. Cloud Run currently uses minimum instances zero and request-based CPU. Its in-process cron is not guaranteed to run while idle. Reliable idle-time recovery needs a separate approved runtime/billing choice or an external scheduler trigger; no deployment billing setting was changed here.
4. Published outbox rows are retained for operational history, and this change adds no cleanup policy. Monitor table growth and decide retention/cleanup separately.
5. The repository has pre-existing pending changes from earlier work. This handoff does not imply they were all created by CHANGE-063; inspect `git status` and stage only reviewed paths. No commit was created for this change.

## Current source of truth

Use `changes/CHANGE-063-transactional-outbox.md`, `docs/decisions/ADR-013-transactional-outbox.md`, `docs/architecture-evolution.md`, `docs/requirements-traceability.md`, and the linked diagrams for the durable specification. This handoff summarizes the implementation for Vincent and does not replace those records.
