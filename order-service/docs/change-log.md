# Approved Change Log

## CHANGE-158 - Gated real compensation integration

Vincent2026-10-27 approves actual transport and real local integration tests.
ADR-055: persisted-policy cutover repair, exact gateway isolation and default-off
local wiring; Credit recovery-fixture clock repair; unchanged message schemas.
See changes/CHANGE-158-real-compensation-integration.md for evidence/rollout gates.

## CHANGE-157 - Compensation CI fixture repair

Vincent requests reproducing/fixing upstream Maven verify. Correct the compensation
integration fixture's unsupported messaging mode and isolate its transport;
preserve real PostgreSQL scenarios, production validation and coverage gates.
See [CHANGE-157](../changes/CHANGE-157-compensation-ci-fixture-repair.md) for exact
CI root cause and RED/GREEN/full verification evidence. ADR-054/live gate unchanged.

## CHANGE-156 - Compensation-first recovery fixture milestone

Vincent-approved opt-in compensation policy for the initial three Credit mutations
and manual repost reservation. Durable step/final status, V15 command-owned outbox
references and result inbox; one initial financial attempt, fenced compensation
decision and matching-result completion. New HTTP mode fails closed. Actual Credit
consumer/result publisher, missing-key tombstones and safe clear reversal remain
FEEDBACK-017. See [change record](../changes/CHANGE-156-compensation-first-recovery.md)
and [peer handoff](../concurrency/compensation-workflow-handoff.md). Verification
evidence/limitations are recorded there; no whole-feature/Sprint completion claim.

## CHANGE-140 — Twenty-row admin table pages

Orders/mock Users table pages now request20, retaining server pagination and actual smaller result counts. See [CHANGE-140](../changes/CHANGE-140-admin-table-page-size.md).


## CHANGE-139 — Compact calendar toolbar

Compact table-top actions, calendar-only date controls and existing icon-only refresh. Real SQL admin date/status/ID search, local-day conversion, filtered totals and isolated mock equivalent. See [change record](../changes/CHANGE-139-compact-admin-toolbar-date-filter.md).


## CHANGE-138 — Admin Order resolution UI

Single selected-row toolbar, shared cancel/complete dialog, explicit penalty/no-penalty and preset/custom reason; optional backend persistence and V11 with compatible replay. See [change record](../changes/CHANGE-138-admin-order-resolution-ui.md) for verification and migration evidence.


## CHANGE-137 — Admin completion including report-held Orders

CHANGE-137 / ADR-046, approved Yao Xiang2026-10-17: AdminOrderController adds
POST /api/orders/admin/{orderId}/complete. Assigned ACCEPTED/IN_PROGRESS/PICKED_UP/
DELIVERED may become COMPLETED, including held Orders. Stored participant IDs must
match. Publish existing Credit completion event plus at most one highest selected
penalty addition; null/empty means WAIVED, no automatic overdue penalty or reward.
Locked atomic decision/checkpoint/receipt/outbox and bound ADMIN_COMPLETE replay;
hold history and actual timing preserved, no fabricated delivery. Ordinary hold
guards remain. Reuses V10 columns/topics; no migration, UI, peer or cloud change.
HTTP200 confirms local intents, not Credit settlement or User score application.


## CHANGE-136 — Admin controller consolidation and annotation imports

CHANGE-136 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-17): AdminOrderController now owns both GET
/api/orders and POST /api/orders/admin/{orderId}/cancel. The separate cancellation
controller is removed; paths, roles, validation, transaction service and event
contracts are unchanged. OrderResponse imports Schema normally; JsonProperty
retains isCompletionHold/isOverdue and Schema documents nullable timing.


## CHANGE-135 — 2026-10-17

Approved START-based timing, additive nullable response fields, persisted admin
waiver/addition decision and SQL auto-completion selection. Removes query-based
reader. V10 migration; existing funding holds and event wires remain. Verification
and local migration results are recorded in changes/CHANGE-135-start-based-delivery-timing.md.


CHANGE-134 / ADR-044 (Yao Xiang2026-10-16): POST /api/orders/admin/{orderId}/cancel
accepts requesterId, nullable courierId and optional appliedPenalties. Admin-only;
all active/held states -> CANCELLED; locked stored participants, maximum one
addition, no successful reward; refund and optional penalty commit in outbox.
Common adds COURIER_UNRESPONSIVE=3. OrderResponse nullable isOverdue is calculated
from grouped checkpoint timings (actual delivery freezes result). Existing
roles/topics/schedulers unchanged; Report/User integration remains pending.


CHANGE-133 (Yao Xiang2026-10-15): nine merge conflicts resolved preserving both
workstreams; real selected-user Admin Credit history linked, paginated/error/retry.
Base mocks retained, balances pending; no global tab or sibling implementation edit.

three static selection methods, Order imports and reward-helper adoption.
Tests/docs amended; constants/amounts/JSON unchanged, no peer/deploy change.

CHANGE-131 (Yao Xiang2026-10-15): D1 NTH2 shared enum complete with wrong

CHANGE-130 (Yao Xiang2026-10-15, ADR-043): ordinary foc-common Maven penalty
enum extraction only, Order first consumer; root wrapper/reactor, root-context
Order Docker/Compose/CI/staging and shared-change detection. Policy/event JSON
unchanged; no auth, peer implementation, database, frontend or cloud operation.

CHANGE-129 (Yao Xiang2026-10-14, ADR-042): shared-role User/Supplier active
involvement endpoints, SQL EXISTS/current relationships including held Orders;
two-field mapped responses. Missing/null supplier lookups show Deleted supplier.
420 backend/129 frontend tests, original coverage gates, lint/typecheck/build pass.
Peer callbacks/deletion coordination/browser rollout pending; no schema/config change.
CHANGE-128 (Yao Xiang2026-10-14, ADR-041): approved +2 accepted cancellation,
+1 overdue delivery and -1 successful delivery, explicit add/deduct events.
New abort publication replaced; Credit events and legacy outbox replay retained.
Exact courier payload/stable retry ID; actual User subscriber remains FEEDBACK-014.

CHANGE-127 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-14): approved requester-owned active-Order holds,
forwarded Firebase auth, funding guards, SQL filters/locked rechecks and UI.
ADR-040/V9 implemented; immutable report insert prevents rebinding races;
stale completion returns report message.394 backend/126 frontend tests pass,
coverage/typecheck/lint/build pass. Local schema9 preserves seven Orders.
Report caller/release/browser/cloud rollout pending; full NTH2/NTH3 partial.

CHANGE-125 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-13): central Admin font/theme scope matches shared

Single-UID live lookup uses the same wrappers. Existing behavior is preserved.

CHANGE-120 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-13): screenshot-driven mobile Order filter fix.
Status and Order ID now share one responsive form/grid row, Search/Clear below
on mobile and inline on desktop. Layout only; existing119 integrations retained.

CHANGE-119 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-13): explicit user-approved environment-aware Admin
adapter. Local emulator keeps samples; outside local completed real providers
are used, missing User/Credit features show Coming soon/disabled controls, no
mock fallback or peer/backend/config changes. Tests first; verification in119.

Supplier map/status changes remain; no backend/contract/data/config change.

CHANGE-115 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-12): Order metadata then credits/wide-description

| [CHANGE-049](../changes/CHANGE-049-openapi-springdoc-test-context.md) | 2026-09-30 | Implemented; Java 21 Maven verification passed | Scoped the MVC OpenAPI test to Springdoc's JSON API configurations, removed its unnecessary Swagger UI configuration, and verified 43 tests plus the JaCoCo gate; no runtime API or peer-service source changed |
| [CHANGE-050](../changes/CHANGE-050-java-layering-and-dto-refactor.md) | 2026-10-01 | Implemented; full suite verified in CHANGE-054 | Replaced compact record DTOs, DTO factory mapping, and application-layer Spring Data calls with named DTO classes, an explicit MapStruct response mapper, domain repository interfaces, infrastructure persistence adapters, explicit types, Lombok boilerplate, and conventional Java formatting; public behavior and schema are unchanged |
| [CHANGE-051](../changes/CHANGE-051-overall-design-update-comparison.md) | 2026-10-02 | Design source synchronized; implementation blocked pending approval | Compared the new overall design source, updated fingerprints and architecture/contract/traceability records for typed completion and cancellation events, transactional outbox, broker fan-out, independent Credit/User subscribers, and same-order accepted reopening; no application code changed |

## Effective compact-event amendment — CHANGE-092 / ADR-031 (2026-10-09)

Yao Xiang approved the exact seven-field Order-only payload: eventId, eventType, orderId, orderStatus, creditAmount, occurredAt, courierId. This replaces full snapshots and overdue facts ONLY for OpenOrderRefundTaskEvent and OrderCompletionTaskEvent. AcceptedOrderCancellationTaskEvent retains its existing v1 envelope/snapshot. Internal outbox versions and Pub/Sub eventVersion attribute remain (compact schema v2); topic names and DB schema unchanged. Old pending snapshot rows normalize at dispatch from their saved facts, with stable IDs. Lifecycle/outbox scheduling, locks, synchronous Credit assignment/reset and ADR-025 abort behavior remain. Historical v1 descriptions below are superseded for these two bodies. Credit currently requires the old snapshot and overdue; FEEDBACK-009 is INCOMPLETE_OR_INCOMPATIBLE. User completion penalties need an agreed separate overdue source. User approved implementing Order-only and documenting peer work; live integration remains blocked, Sprint [~].

## Lifecycle per-order failure isolation — CHANGE-093 (2026-10-09)

Yao Xiang explicitly requests failed scheduled tasks be skipped while later successes continue. Due selection returns IDs filtered in the DB (latest delivery cutoff for completion), without locking a whole batch. Nontransactional lifecycle coordinator calls fresh NOWAIT-locking per-order transactions (expiry worker / existing autoComplete with REQUIRES_NEW), catches each RuntimeException including commit failures, logs order ID, counts only successful transitions, then continues. Scheduler retains independent whole-pass catches. Failed orders remain eligible next normal lifecycle pass; no new repost retry mechanism or cron/contract/schema/peer change. Previous batch transaction description is superseded by this refinement; CHANGE-092 compact payloads and FEEDBACK-009 remain unchanged.

## CHANGE-094 — Order UI polling and personal status filters (2026-10-09)

Yao Xiang explicitly authorizes five-second Order polling, Abort errand wording and My Requests/My Errands filters. ADR-032 supersedes only Order polling interval; optional status on existing mine endpoint filters current/history before DB pagination/count, retaining ownership and requester repost hiding. Existing shared frontend primitives/gateway reused. 58 frontend and22 focused backend tests pass; fresh verify 219 passed/24 Docker skips, coverage gates passed. Browser fixture checks both pages at 320/768/1440/1920; real auth/peer/DB verification remains pending. Normal frontend build blocked by Google Fonts connectivity.

## CHANGE-095 — Correct personal status options (2026-10-09)

Explicit user correction: My Requests excludes ABORTED; My Errands excludes OPEN/EXPIRED/CANCELLED. Existing mode-aware filter/callers and option/pagination tests updated; no backend change. Tests first: 2 failures / 6 passes; final full frontend 60 passes, lint zero errors (12 unrelated warnings), typecheck passes, eight isolated browser cases at 320/768/1440/1920 pass.

## CHANGE-096 — Scheduler database selection and isolation (2026-10-10)

Audited existing lifecycle isolation, repaired outbox retry-write/claim failure isolation and moved active recovery to database due-ID selection plus per-event transactions. Tests-first regression: 1 expected failure (retry database unavailable), target/change096-red.log. Focused 43 tests passed, including eight PostgreSQL lifecycle/outbox isolation tests; fresh source-only wrapper-selected Maven 3.9.16 / Java21 offline verify: 252 tests passed, 0 failures/errors/skips, including 28 PostgreSQL tests. JaCoCo 95.99% lines / 83.72% branches; unchanged >=80% gates passed. Logs: target/change096-focused.log and target/change096-verify.log; reports target/change096-source-check/target/. Docker28.4.0; isolated PostgreSQL15 Testcontainers; new isolation suites mock all cloud publishers. No application database, peer service, real topic or cloud setting changed. See changes/CHANGE-096-scheduler-database-isolation.md.

## Missing supplier references in Order cards — CHANGE-097 (2026-10-10)

CHANGE-097 repairs Order UI loading when Supplier lookup successfully reports missingIds: use the existing Location unavailable card label for terminal missing references. Orders still display; no contract/peer/auth/schema/polling change. Three hook regressions (two fail first); final63 frontend tests, lint/typecheck and Docker build pass. Rebuilt only local frontend; runtime pages/assets and corrected hook verified served. Saved supplier data remains missing; authenticated browser confirmation pending.

## Swagger current-origin server — CHANGE-098 (2026-10-10)

CHANGE-098 sets an explicit relative OpenAPI server / through OpenApiConfiguration. Swagger now resolves API calls against the origin serving the specification, retaining /api/orders paths and Firebase authorization. Live staging docs previously advertised an HTTP backend host despite HTTPS gateway UI. This is an Order-only documentation routing implementation detail; no gateway, peer, CORS allowlist, forwarded-header trust, schema, frontend or deployment-env change. Tests first: one expected server-URL failure and one existing documentation pass (target/change098-red.log). Fresh source-only wrapper-selected Maven3.9.16/Java21 offline verify:253 tests,0 failures/errors/skips, including28 PostgreSQL tests; coverage96.00% lines (1441/1501),83.72% branches (468/559), unchanged >=80% gates pass. Generated target/openapi.json servers=[{url:"/",description:"Current gateway or service origin"}];160 current POM/source/test/resource files equal the fresh tested copy. Logs/reports target/change098-verify.log and target/change098-source-check/target/, evidence target/change098-evidence.json. git diff --check passes. No local application container rebuild or real authenticated browser request; no commit/push/cloud deployment. Staging remains unchanged until Order Service redeployment.

## Main merge feedback conflict and CI checks - 2026-10-10

Main merge a641836 resolves the prior stale-branch infrastructure expectation: current Credit has three typed endpoints, and both scripts/ci/check-infra.sh and infra/gcp/configure-credit-pubsub.sh use their corresponding paths. Those incoming-main scripts were preserved byte-for-byte. Resolved the sole peer-service-api-feedback.md conflict to JsonOrderEventPayloadDecoder/typed handlers with former v1 semantics labeled; retained exactly seven compact keys and OPEN FEEDBACK-009. Corrected its removed CreditOrderEventConsumer reference. Only that conflict was staged; every other existing index entry was preserved. Earlier shared-URL cloud repair used stale branch code and was reversed: all three original event-specific staging paths are restored, including completion confirmed after the interrupted turn. This supersedes the earlier claimed shared-path root cause; Order commit86708cb changed neither these scripts/routes nor the POM/workflow.

Standard online wrapper-selected Maven3.9.16/Java21 -B -ntp verify, without -U/offline mode, passed 258 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, including isolated PostgreSQL Testcontainers; coverage gates pass. Current161 POM/src/resource files equal the fresh tested copy. ShellCheck0.11.0 on all CI/infra shell scripts, actionlint1.7.12 on workflows, staged/unstaged diff checks and conflict/index/source/contract checks pass. Logs/reports target/main-merge-ci-verify.log and target/main-merge-ci-source-check/target/. First live cloud run reported two IAM failures while showing a concrete Google IAM DNS NameResolutionError; no deleted account/removed IAM inference. Repeat live infrastructure result pending; all three typed subscription predicates passed during first run. Current Maven artifact resolution passes but arbitrary hosted runner/network failures cannot be guaranteed absent. Reverted CI/helper changes were not reintroduced.

Final merge verification: Final live scripts/ci/check-infra.sh staging production rerun PASSED with all identities, databases, access, all three event-specific push subscriptions/DLQ/OIDC and buckets; production push stays intentionally disabled. The first-run two false-negative IAM checks were transient DNS failures and cleared on rerun. The prior subscription mismatch and Maven model failure did not reproduce on the merged tree. Hosted/WIF CI must still run after the user completes/pushes the merge; no arbitrary remote-network guarantee. Merge conflict remains resolved/staged, MERGE_HEAD intentionally present; no merge commit/push or application-container rebuild. FEEDBACK-009 and other peer business/semantic gaps remain open.


CHANGE-141 / ADR-048: delivered-item report review, single Resolved status, stored delivery overdue, report-specific release and precompletion penalty waiver. See changes/CHANGE-141-delivered-reports-and-review.md and docs/decisions/ADR-048-delivered-report-review.md. No workflow or skill changes.


CHANGE-142 (2026-10-18), user-directed presentation refinement: Report detail and submission use one continuous panel, with Order summary before report metadata and aligned definition-list rows. Admin clicks the Order summary to navigate to existing /admin/orders/{id}; no separate View full order details button and no financial actions on Report pages. Only Mark report resolved remains. Existing Order page actions, API/mocks/auth/statuses/polling and DB stay unchanged. GOV.UK summary-list structure informed layout; FoC theme retained.


CHANGE-143 (2026-10-18): Report Order summary has labelled Description and requester/courier display names. Status label sits above one equal-height select/refresh row. Admin Orders live list/details resolve distinct User summary and Supplier detail IDs independently via existing gateway/token transport; never block Orders on name failure or substitute sample data. Loading labels, Deleted labels for404/empty, unavailable for transient errors; copy/navigation IDs preserved. No global name cache, DB-owned names or API/config changes. Live Reports remains Coming soon until FEEDBACK-015 provider exists.


CHANGE-144: synchronous pending/confirmation penalty replacement contract stub, per-attempt outcomes/V13 and local mock UI; live disabled pending User FEEDBACK-016. Reports Open/Closed cards, no deadline, required resolution reply. Verification in CHANGE-144.


CHANGE-145 (2026-10-18): Report card status badge aligns top-right, preserving the title/content layout. CSS-only frontend change, no new contract.


CHANGE-146 / ADR-050 (2026-10-19): retire synchronous penalty replacement and admin completion; monotonic stored report penalty, final max(policy,overdue) through existing events, admin cancellation never considers overdue. Additive V14, approved shared frontend slice. Verification pending.


CHANGE-147 (2026-10-19): submitter-only resolution replies; retire courier-unresponsive from new choices with history compatibility; single-choice cancellation; simplified/muted navigable Reports; separate account name/ID; bounded admin table text. Verification pending.

CHANGE-147 verification (2026-10-19): full root Maven verify passed 520 Order tests and12 common tests,0 failures/errors/skips; final focused verify passed45 Order plus12 common tests, including the subsequently added cancellation-retired-case test (521 current Order tests across runs). Unchanged coverage gate passed. Frontend full243 tests and final18 focused tests pass; TypeScript, final production build and lint pass (0 errors/3 existing login warnings). Order and frontend Docker images built successfully as change147-check tags; no existing containers replaced. Automated Edge preview1440x1000 and390x844 plus screenshot inspection confirmed private-reply copy, separate name/profile and ID/copy rows, muted closed cards remain navigable, three radio cases with one selected, and no unresponsive option. Extreme name/email/user-ID fixture measured columns176/224/192px; full ID remains in copy/title, no service record changed. Found/fixed existing multiline status badge clipping; final measured41px height, scrollHeight=clientHeight39. Temporary account/processes/isolated change147_preview DB removed; existing Compose data untouched. git diff --check passes. Full peer-service CI/cloud checks and real Report integration were not run; Reports remain local-only/Coming soon live. No commit or staging.


CHANGE-148 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: presentation-only refinement in existing Admin/reports components. Completion hold displays Yes/No. Refresh icon shares Open reports heading row; normal participant section controls remain available. Cancellation uses muted Choose one penalty case/highest-selected guidance and requested stored-penalty warning. Remove score-event/overdue-comparison implementation details from Apply Penalty description. No API, backend, data, scoring, authentication, navigation, schema or deployment behavior change. Reuse existing components/theme. Existing component tests/typecheck/build and frontend image verification pending; no new tests for reversible copy/CSS edits.


CHANGE-148 verification:18 existing focused UI tests pass; production Next build including TypeScript passes; lint0 errors/3 pre-existing login warnings; frontend Docker image foc-frontend:change148-check builds successfully; git diff --check passes. Reviewed responsive flex heading placement in source; no new browser session for this copy/layout-only change. Backend tests/image not rerun because no backend source, contract or schema changed. No existing container restarted, commit or staging. Reports remain local mock/live Coming soon.


CHANGE-149 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: Reports reuse existing Order-style Status/Order ID/Search/Clear form, remove manual refresh icon, retain visible five-second polling and Open/Closed groups. Status means report status (Awaiting courier response, Ready for review, Resolved). Exact trimmed Order ID plus report status filter on local mock before pagination/counts; independent page counters reset on filter changes. Preserve participant scoping/reply privacy. Extend existing gated sample GET with optional orderId/reportStatus; no real Report endpoint, sibling backend, scoring, database or deployment changes. Live Reports remain Coming soon. TDD and verification pending.


CHANGE-149 verification,2026-10-19: full root Maven verify SUCCESS,522 Order +12 common tests,0 failures/errors/skips, unchanged coverage gates pass. Frontend full245 tests plus final12 focused report/transport tests pass (final test explicitly exercises page2 -> search reset to page1). Production build/TypeScript and Order/frontend Docker image builds pass; lint0 errors/3 existing login warnings; git diff --check passes. Isolated browser HTTP checks at1440x1000 and390x844 pass exact search, report status intersection, clear restoration, no refresh button, aligned controls (0px vertical delta) and no overflow. Sample server filters before page/counts and retains privacy/scoping. Preview account/processes/verified change149_preview database removed; existing containers/data preserved. No cloud, peer backend, schema, CI configuration, commit or staging change. Real Report Service remains unavailable; live Reports remain Coming soon. Full peer CI/cloud IAM not run.


CHANGE-150 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: remove separate Open/Closed report sections. One server-paginated card list under the existing Order ID/report-status filters; one five-second polling query with blank grouping selector (all statuses). Preserve grey styling and View report for RESOLVED cards. Filters and participant-tab changes reset the single page. Existing backend supports this query; no backend, endpoint, data or scoring change. TDD regressions cover mixed active/resolved results, one query, filtering/page reset and retained navigation. Verification pending.


CHANGE-150 verification:245 frontend tests pass; new expectations first reproduced the two-query/grouped-list mismatch, then passed after implementation. TypeScript/production build and frontend Docker image foc-frontend:change150-check pass; lint0 errors/3 existing login warnings; git diff --check passes. Isolated sample browser1440x1000 and390x844 verified a single mixed active/resolved grid, no group headings, grey resolved card with working View link and Resolved filtering; screenshots inspected. Single page reset/search remains covered. Backend source/API/schema unchanged, backend suite not repeated. No sibling service, shared infrastructure, existing containers/data, commit or staging change. Reports remain local sample/live Coming soon.


CHANGE-151 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: replace floating Base UI status-filter popups with one Order-owned native HTML StatusSelect. Covers My Requests, My Errands, Admin Orders and normal/Admin Reports in mock/live modes. Existing role-specific option sets, labels, selected values, search/Clear, page resets and polling remain. Native browser keyboard/touch dropdown; consistent existing theme/height/borders. No global Select changes, creation/reason controls, sibling service, backend, API, score, schema or deployment change. Regression tests use native change events and verify actual select controls. Verification pending.


CHANGE-151 verification: full245 frontend tests pass; final8 personal-list tests also pass after removing an obsolete tuple label. Native SELECT assertions/requester-courier option sets, selected-status requests, page reset and pending-command visibility verified. Initial build exposed stale test tuple typing (fixed); separate host build encountered existing Google Fonts fetch/network failure, then network-enabled retry passed without source/config/font changes. Final TypeScript/production build, frontend Docker build and lint pass (0 errors/3 existing login warnings); git diff --check passes. Isolated Edge browser1440x1000/390x844 checked Admin Orders(10 options), Admin Reports(4), normal Reports(4), My Requests(9), My Errands(7): actual native select, keyboard End/Home changes, no phone overflow. Screenshots inspected. Preview-only account/processes/change151_preview database removed, existing application data/containers unchanged. No backend/contract/schema/shared configuration/peer service changes; backend suite not repeated for this frontend-only change. No commit or staging.


CHANGE-152 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: remove all normal-mode Reports UI: /reports, /reports/new, /reports/[id], normal sidebar entry, submit/response/evidence-upload forms, participant tabs/branches and unused frontend submission helpers/types. Retain only AdminReportsPage under existing RequireAuth/AdminGate layout, Admin list/search/status/pagination/polling, grey resolved cards, linked Order/user details, evidence/response viewing and resolve-with-reply. Local admin sample/live Coming soon unchanged. Backend sample fixtures/endpoints, report/hold/domain rules and future Report Service requirements remain; this is UI-scope removal only. No sibling/backend/config/data changes. User explicitly authorized removal; deleted source backed up under ignored target for recovery. Verification pending.


CHANGE-152 verification:245 frontend tests pass, including new no-normal-Reports navigation/no-submission-client-helper regressions (both reproduced failures before removal), retained admin search/page reset/mixed/resolved/details/reply tests and existing admin-role gates. Production build/TypeScript, frontend Docker image foc-frontend:change152-check, lint(0 errors/3 existing login warnings) and git diff --check pass. Built route manifest retains only /admin/reports and /admin/reports/[id]. Isolated HTTP/browser confirms /reports,/reports/new,/reports/sample-report each404, normal sidebar has no Reports, Admin Reports list/details and resolve-with-reply succeed; no courier input/upload forms. Desktop1440x1000/phone390x844 screenshots inspected. Normal navigation screenshot captured while unrelated Order data still loading; Credit balance unavailable in the Order-only preview (no Credit proxy), not an application regression claim. Preview-only account/processes/change152_preview DB removed, existing application data/containers preserved. No backend/schema/config/peer service change, so backend suite not repeated. Live Admin Reports remains Coming soon until Report Service integration. No commit or staging.


CHANGE-153 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: allow a NEW requester-owned report completion hold on any Order status except COMPLETED, including cancelled/expired/aborted historical states. Placing a hold preserves status and cannot undo previously committed funds. START/PICKUP/DELIVER (and existing acceptance behavior) continue; requester/automatic completion, normal cancellation, expiry and courier abort remain paused while held. Admin cancellation remains the prior explicit override. Preserve locking, report-ID binding/idempotency, release/multiple-hold history, auth, SQL exclusions and event rules. No schema, frontend, peer backend or shared config change. Report Service integration is still pending. TDD and verification next.


CHANGE-153 verification: full reactor Maven verify passed (531 Order Service tests plus 12 foc-common tests, zero failures/errors/skips; JaCoCo coverage checks passed). New eligibility cases reproduced seven old-rule failures before the implementation. Updated the obsolete delivered-only PostgreSQL regression to reject COMPLETED instead; new OPEN placement and held delivery progression are covered alongside existing funding, rollback and concurrency guards. Docker image foc-order-service:change153-check built successfully; git diff --check passed. No application containers/data changed, frontend edits, schema changes, cloud calls, staging or commits. Live Report Service integration remains pending.


CHANGE-154 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: documentation-only peer coordination. Clarify new penalty addition/deduction events supersede new accepted-cancellation scoring; preserve old outbox/backlog support pending owner reconciliation. Request provider-enforced Firebase/admin-role checks for admin directory/profile/promotion/deactivation and separately document Credit balance readiness. Existing self-service contracts preserved; exact new admin routes not finalized. No sibling service, runtime, frontend, schema, topic/config or cloud edits. Verification: documentation consistency review and git diff --check; no tests required for prose-only change. User consumer/live admin readiness remain pending. No commit or staging.


CHANGE-155 (2026-10-19), Yao Xiang: retire accepted-cancellation producer/replay/snapshot types and topic keys/provisioning/CI requirements under explicit cleanup approval. Preserve financial transitions, four current event channels, published history and immutable migrations. Staging user query showed eight PUBLISHED rows only; other deployment databases require backlog checks before rollout. No database/cloud/sibling backend edits; no frontend impact. TDD: bootstrap expectations failed2 cases and retired-event dispatch failed1 case before implementation. Verification in progress; no staging/commit.


CHANGE-155 verification: final full reactor verify passed: 531 Order tests +12 common tests, zero failures/errors/skips; coverage checks passed with fresh execution data and no class-mismatch warning. First full run also passed but accumulated old mapper coverage, so only jacoco.exec was backed up/cleared before the final run (no Maven clean). Local bootstrap3 tests pass; base/http-peers/http-peers+local-live Compose config checks pass; shell syntax and stubbed staging/production provisioning pass (four topics each; no live gcloud calls). AsyncAPI checker passes four channels/operations, four DTO field sets, six examples, negative schemas and source/config/cadence parity; initial stale validator/missing example attributes were corrected. AsyncAPI parses and all local refs resolve. Docker foc-order-service:change155-check built; packaged JAR contains no retired event/publisher/snapshot classes; git diff --check passes. Production backlog and deployed User scoring remain unverified. No DB/GCP modifications, app-container recreation, commit or staging.


CHANGE-159 (2026-10-28): Order reporting contract/admin integration; see changes/CHANGE-159-report-contract-and-admin-provider-integration.md and ADR-056. Verification pending.


CHANGE-159 final verification (2026-10-28): full root reactor verify PASS,654 Order +12 common tests, zero testcase failures/errors/skips, coverage gates pass. The first full run found one old OpenAPI schema assertion and one expired test fixture; both corrected and targeted38 tests passed, followed by final full verification. Added final auth/caller scoping and persisted zero-outcome checks. Surefire logs a30-second lingering fork shutdown/termination after tests (build exits0); no production shutdown issue is inferred. Frontend locked npm ci,253 tests, lint(0 errors/warnings), typecheck and production build pass; both fresh Docker images foc-order-service:change159-check/foc-frontend:change159-check build. New OpenAPI paths, exact six hold-response fields, boolean-only placement body and documentation links validated; git diff --check passes. No migration, live cloud invocation/deployment, real Report integration or authenticated deployed browser validation. Docker Desktop was started for isolated test databases; no application volumes removed. No commit or staging.


- CHANGE-160: ready-only Admin APIs, ID-only User search, independent local-only Report demo and pending-only peer contract indexes. Verification pending.

CHANGE-160 final verification (2026-10-28): native Maven exit0, full reactor verify PASS (644 Order +12 common =656 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; unchanged coverage gates pass). Frontend252 tests pass; lint0 errors/warnings, host typecheck/production build and fresh Order/frontend Docker builds pass. Both Compose configurations validate with native exit0. Same frontend image in isolated local/staging containers serves health200, always real Admin APIs, mock Reports only locally despite a stale generic mock flag; preview containers removed. Fresh Order image contains Report-only fixtures and no AdminMock classes. Initial PowerShell stderr redirection reported wrapper exit1 despite successful logs; direct native rerun confirmed Maven/tests/images/configuration exit0. No sibling backend, migration, database/GCP mutation, application-container recreation, commit or staging. Pending name search, User penalty subscribers, Supplier deactivation guard and Report integration remain explicit; deployed authenticated browser integration is unverified. Sample Report identities are not real User/Order provider records.

- CHANGE-161: narrow real User directory endpoint and frontend initial list/name/ID search; full-width Admin resolution below repost, legacy waiver fields hidden. User handoff and Report-only pending Admin HTTP contract checklist. Verification in progress.

CHANGE-161 final verification (2026-10-29): User Service native Maven verify exit0,36 tests pass with zero failures/errors/skips, including4 real Mongo directory tests and3 active-admin/security/error route tests plus OpenAPI contract checks. Frontend252 tests, lint0 errors/warnings, typecheck and production build pass. Fresh foc-user-service:change161-check and foc-frontend:change161-check image builds exit0. Real User image + isolated Mongo HTTP checks pass14 requests: initial20/25 and page2, literal/case-insensitive names, exact UID/deactivated display, empty result, query400, missing/wrong-project/expired token401, non-admin403, existing profile200 and documented secure route. Temporary test/HTTP containers and network removed; existing application data untouched. Initial failed runs were stale generated pre-refactor User classes plus missing test-slice HttpSecurity setup, an obsolete frontend capability assertion and an HTTP-harness lifetime issue; only generated outputs/test harness/fixture were corrected, production auth was not refactored. Order backend source/lifecycle/schema/compensation unchanged this turn; its already-passing CHANGE-160 suite was not repeated. User changes are limited to3 new endpoint/query/DTO production files, tests/test dependency and handoff/README. No Supplier/Credit changes, new env vars, cloud deployment, commit or staging. Report integration remains pending; separate User subscriber/Supplier guard follow-ups are retained. No authenticated deployed browser/visual screenshot claim.


CHANGE-162 (2026-10-29): approved guarded Report resolution contract stub, V18 journal/inbox, synchronous admin resolve and atomic release, durable fenced Pub/Sub compensation/result, independent recovery and direct-release guard. Default disabled; Report provider/GCP/UI activation absent. See changes/CHANGE-162-report-resolution-compensation-saga.md and docs/report-servicehandoff.md. Final verification pending.


CHANGE-162 final verification (2026-10-29): native full Order/common Maven verify exit0,661 Order +12 common =673 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, unchanged coverage gates pass (Order94.65% LINE/80.67% BRANCH). After final OpenAPI parameter annotations, targeted10 contract/security/OpenAPI tests pass; strengthened PostgreSQL saga9 tests pass, including explicit PUBLISHED-before-rearm and stable compensation identity. Fresh foc-order-service:change162-check image builds exit0. Isolated fresh-image smoke health200/schema18 and default-disabled resolve/status/result routes absent from OpenAPI; temporary test containers/network removed. Both Compose configurations validate. AsyncAPI1.5.0 validates8 channels/operations,8 DTO sets/11 examples and negative/source/default/topic parity; context TOML valid; git diff --check and conflict scan clean. Initial full-run failures were two schema/FK expectations and host/DB due-time test skew, corrected. Host Python unavailable, so Python checks used read-only disposable containers; initial inline TOML invocation had Windows quoting failure, corrected with a script. No frontend/sibling production change in162, app-data/GCP mutation, deployment, staging or commit. Real Report restore/fence/result delivery and cloud OIDC/IAM remain unverified; integration defaults disabled.


CHANGE-163 (2026-10-29), Yao Xiang: documentation-only approved Report clarification. Retain response deadline and server readiness; early admin resolution with warning/confirmation; required private admin reply/audit and ADR-059 saga requirements documented. Category remains undecided. Updated handoff/pending requests/context/ADR060/sequence/traceability; no application, SQL, env or cloud change. See changes/CHANGE-163-report-deadline-reply-and-saga-handoff.md.


CHANGE-164 (2026-10-29), Yao Xiang: fix automatic-repost permanent exclusion after safe failure. Fresh keyed attempts on later scheduler passes after no-effect/confirmed compensation; SQL eligibility/fair failure ordering/latest attempt, existing lock/pending/funding guards retained. Three production files, regression tests and context/docs only; no migration/peer/API/env/frontend/cloud change. RED3 failures reproduced, focused20 actual Order/Credit/PubSub tests pass; full verify in progress.


CHANGE-164 final verification (2026-10-29): native full Order/common Maven verify exit0,666 Order +12 common =678 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; original coverage gates pass (Order94.86% LINE/80.98% BRANCH). Actual Order/Credit/PostgreSQL/PubSub compensation suite21 tests passes, including concurrent fresh retries with one successor/reservation, pre-Credit timeout recovery on later scheduler passes, insufficient funds then recovery, lost applied Credit response/confirmed reversal before fresh attempt, pending-effect barrier, holds/expiry, refund lag and manual guards. User/Supplier eligibility checks remain explicit fixtures in that suite, not a deployed peer claim. Three regressions failed before the fix; initial focused20 passed before the final race test. Fresh foc-order-service:change164-check image builds exit0. Context TOML and git diff/conflict checks pass. No frontend/schema/API/topic/env/feature-gate/sibling production or GCP change; no application data/container recreation, deployment, commit or staging. Existing safely failed eligible plans recover without deleting/resetting old commands after rollout; unresolved compensation/FAILED publication still requires existing recovery/redrive and is never bypassed.


CHANGE-165 (2026-10-29), Yao Xiang on order-service/admin-ui-linking: user explicitly requests fixing User CI AdminUserDirectoryTest Mongo8 container-start error. Pin only that test fixture to mongo:7.0.43, matching existing Order/User integration. No production code, dependency, environment, database schema or CI workflow change. Full standalone User verify native exit0:36 tests/0 failures/errors/skips, including4 real directory cases and OpenAPI. Both test databases are disposable Mongo7 replica sets; no application data modified. Test container/image behavior on GitHub requires the CI rerun; the provided excerpt did not include the underlying Mongo crash output. See order-service/changes/CHANGE-165-user-directory-ci-mongo-image.md and user-service/user-servicehandoff.md relative to repository root for peer details. No commit, push, deployment or staging.
