# Current Developer Profile

CHANGE-135 / ADR-045 (Yao Xiang, 2026-10-17) supersedes the earlier overdue
reader: persist deliveryDeadlineAt at courier START plus delivery duration and
deliveredAt at delivery. isOverdue is a nullable timestamp comparison, without
checkpoint queries or a flag-refresh scheduler. Actual delivery freezes lateness;
adminResolutionAt freezes undelivered admin cancellations. Unstarted/unknown
legacy/historical timing stays null. Completion uses those same persisted facts.
V10 adds these timing fields and admin decision/reason/amount/resolution time;
WAIVED and ADDITION_REQUESTED record intent, never subscriber APPLIED. Ordinary
holds still block completion and courier abort; explicit admin cancellation may
resolve held Orders. UI score feedback/callbacks remain deferred. Existing event
payloads/topics/authentication and sibling backends are unchanged. See CHANGE-135.


CHANGE-134 approved2026-10-16: Yao Xiang/current penalty-integration branch;
admin active/held cancellation, all addition cases/highest only, common
COURIER_UNRESPONSIVE=3 and nullable isOverdue. No peer backend/Report UI work.


CHANGE-133 authorization2026-10-15: Yao Xiang on order-service/penalty-integration;
resolve merge and link existing profile Credit history only. No global tab,
sibling backend changes or cloud actions. Current identity below retained.

CHANGE-130 approval, 2026-10-15: Yao Xiang/current penalty-integration branch;
ordinary foc-common penalty policy module and necessary root build/CI/Docker
integration. No authentication or sibling backend implementation extraction.

  queries and existing Order supplier missing-name fallback, layout unchanged.
- CHANGE-128 scope also approved2026-10-14: Order-owned +2/+1/-1 penalty enum,

## Effective current profile — Vincent, 2026-10-10

- Name: Vincent
- Developer number: Developer 2
- Branch: `sprint-2-3-credit-service-concurrency-update-event-payload`
- Sprint: Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, approved durable command recovery contract-stub slice.
- Assigned scope: Order Service and its shared frontend for CREATE, ACCEPT and
  ACCEPTED-only abort recovery; Order-owned migration, tests and cooperation
  handoff under `concurrency/concurrency-order-credit.md`. Sibling services remain
  read-only. No cloud/deployment changes or service credentials.
- Approval: Vincent explicitly confirmed identity/branch and approved the updated
  plan on 2026-10-10. Separately approved a documented contract-stub milestone with
  live HTTP recovery disabled until Credit implements and verifies the contract.
- UI: pending/disabled until terminal outcome; an explicit recovery control only
  when user authorization is needed. No persisted bearer/refresh tokens.

Current authorization (2026-10-10): Vincent confirms this branch and approves
CHANGE-101 JWT learning and CHANGE-102 merging command recovery into the
minute lifecycle job, recovery -> expiry -> completion. Order-only scheduler,
tests and records; no peer, frontend, schema or live-recovery activation.

## Historical Yao Xiang profile from the integrated checkout

Current task authorization: Vincent explicitly approves the fifth PostgreSQL race,
courier acceptance versus requester OPEN cancellation (2026-10-09, CHANGE-093).
Same test-only scope and harness; both winner orderings, no production/peer edits.

Previous task authorization: Vincent explicitly approves real PostgreSQL four-race
tests on the current concurrency branch (2026-10-09, CHANGE-092). Order test-only
scope; cross-service recovery deferred. No peer/schema/production behavior edits.

Historical task authorization: Vincent explicitly approved the one-time Credit
push-security converter fix and regression tests on 2026-10-09, CHANGE-090,
with an interference Markdown handoff. No other peer/source/cloud changes.

Historical task authorization: Vincent explicitly requested Credit integration
inspection and Order feedback updates on sprint-2-3-credit, 2026-10-09,
CHANGE-087. Documentation-only; no peer implementation or cloud writes.

Current scope extension (2026-10-09): Yao Xiang explicitly requests CHANGE-093 Order lifecycle per-task exception/transaction isolation; this narrow Order-only fix is authorized on the same branch. No other Vincent/peer work authorized.

Current scope extension (2026-10-09): Yao Xiang requests CHANGE-094 Order frontend polling/abort labels/personal status filters and necessary Order query contract; shared frontend allocation recorded.
