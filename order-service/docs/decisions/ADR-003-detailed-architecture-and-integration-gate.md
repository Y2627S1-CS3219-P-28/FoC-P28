# ADR-003: Detailed Architecture and Integration Approval Gate

Date: 2026-09-26

Status: Accepted; infrastructure conflict superseded by ADR-008

Approved by: User-provided Order Service architecture-review prompt

## Context

The overall and Sprint 1 diagrams define logical structure but do not settle every feature-level component, concrete peer API, failure mode, communication style, event transport, or operational trade-off. Peer services may also implement contracts that differ from the Order Service's expected logical contracts. Implementing directly from a high-level diagram would permit silent architecture and API drift.

## Decision

1. Every feature or sequence requires a detailed component, class, service-sequence, contract, data, concurrency, consistency, idempotency, failure, security, observability, and test proposal before application code or implementation tests.
2. The proposal must distinguish approved architecture, actual peer implementation, proposed design, unresolved decisions, and user-approved deviations. The user explicitly decides every interaction before implementation.
3. User, Supplier, Credit, and Admin service implementations are inspected for the initial Order Service review. Each later feature rechecks the relevant provider's instructions, APIs/DTOs, adapters, event schemas, tests, authentication, configuration, errors, retries, idempotency, and API documentation.
4. An actual API that differs from the expected contract cannot be used without explicit approval. The review must compare both contracts, risks, adapter feasibility, and provider-change feasibility. A rejected API remains unimplemented and is recorded as an open integration API gap.
5. Every event candidate is compared with synchronous request-response, query/polling, and an in-process domain event. A durable broker requires a specific approval plus delivery, ordering, idempotency, retry/dead-letter recovery, versioning, monitoring, security, and contract-test decisions.
6. For Sequences 5-7, CHANGE-063/ADR-013 supersedes CHANGE-053's publish-first ordering and CHANGE-056 supersedes split completion events: Credit reservation before `OPEN` remains synchronous; CHANGE-064/ADR-014 also requires synchronous Credit hold/reset before unexpired accepted cancellation can transition directly to `OPEN`. Expired accepted cancellation and other outcomes commit typed event intent atomically with status/checkpoint and dispatch after commit. Every completion uses one event with overdue facts. Ordinary progress transitions still do not call Credit.
7. Penalty evaluation remains in User Service. The user authorized Order Service to assume future Credit/User consumers for this producer milestone; no consumer response blocks Order, and peer implementation remains unverified. CHANGE-054 selects Google Cloud Pub/Sub. Database failure after publication may leave an event for unchanged Order state.
8. `OVERDUE` remains an Order-owned flag and timestamp evaluated during completion, with no continuous overdue scheduler.
9. A dashboard, history/list query, internal timer, expiry, or reposting process does not require a broker merely because it is non-real-time or time-based.
10. Record approved architecture decisions and AI assistance before implementation, then follow TDD and the existing completion gate.

## Superseded infrastructure conflict

The Order Service design sources named PostgreSQL and Kubernetes, while the current parent repository instructions require Firestore and Cloud Run. ADR-008 records the user's approved Order Service choice of PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL and Cloud Run. This conflict is no longer a blocker for Order Service infrastructure; the parent Firestore default remains applicable to sibling services.

## Consequences

- Overall architecture is context, not blanket implementation approval.
- No application source, implementation test, broker, contract change, or mismatched API use may precede the relevant explicit approval.
- `docs/integration-api-gaps.md` is created only when a rejected or unavailable provider capability must be tracked; no speculative gap file is required.
- A feature cannot be complete while an architecture decision, API mismatch, or required peer contract test is unresolved.
- This ADR approves the review process and communication boundaries. CHANGE-053/054/056 and ADR-009/011 record approval of the three typed publisher flows, full snapshot, topic placeholders, assumed future consumers, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub. CHANGE-063/ADR-013 approves the outbox migration and post-commit dispatch. Same-order reopening is excluded under ADR-001.
