## Effective compact-event amendment — CHANGE-092 / ADR-031 (2026-10-09)

Yao Xiang approved the exact seven-field Order-only payload: eventId, eventType, orderId, orderStatus, creditAmount, occurredAt, courierId. This replaces full snapshots and overdue facts ONLY for OpenOrderRefundTaskEvent and OrderCompletionTaskEvent. AcceptedOrderCancellationTaskEvent retains its existing v1 envelope/snapshot. Internal outbox versions and Pub/Sub eventVersion attribute remain (compact schema v2); topic names and DB schema unchanged. Old pending snapshot rows normalize at dispatch from their saved facts, with stable IDs. Lifecycle/outbox scheduling, locks, synchronous Credit assignment/reset and ADR-025 abort behavior remain. Historical v1 descriptions below are superseded for these two bodies. Credit currently requires the old snapshot and overdue; FEEDBACK-009 is INCOMPLETE_OR_INCOMPATIBLE. User completion penalties need an agreed separate overdue source. User approved implementing Order-only and documenting peer work; live integration remains blocked, Sprint [~].

- ADR-032: [Order polling and personal status filters](ADR-032-order-polling-and-personal-status-filters.md), user-approved CHANGE-094; existing personal API, five-second Order-only refresh, Abort errand UI terminology.

- ADR-043: [Shared Maven penalty policy](ADR-043-shared-maven-penalty-policy.md), CHANGE-130; ordinary root foc-common, Order first consumer, no auth/event contract change.


CHANGE-141 / ADR-048: delivered-item report review, single Resolved status, stored delivery overdue, report-specific release and precompletion penalty waiver. See changes/CHANGE-141-delivered-reports-and-review.md and docs/decisions/ADR-048-delivered-report-review.md. No workflow or skill changes.


ADR-049 — Synchronous courier-attempt penalty replacement and Report queue refinement (CHANGE-144, approved 2026-10-18). Supersedes only the unshipped adjustment-event proposal and new waiver UI; initial events unchanged.


ADR-050 — Deferred monotonic Order penalty (CHANGE-146), approved Yao Xiang2026-10-19. Supersedes ADR-049 synchronous replacement and the admin completion action in ADR-046. Existing report/hold/event architecture otherwise retained.


[ADR-051 — Private report replies and retired policy](ADR-051-private-report-replies-and-retired-policy.md): CHANGE-147, accepted2026-10-19; caller-scoped reply visibility and active/legacy policy compatibility.


[ADR-052 — Non-completed Order hold eligibility](ADR-052-noncompleted-order-hold-eligibility.md): CHANGE-153, approved2026-10-19; broader placement with existing funding guards retained.

[ADR-053 - Retire accepted-cancellation publishing](ADR-053-retire-accepted-cancellation-publishing.md): CHANGE-155, approved2026-10-19; preserve published history and require deployment backlog checks.
