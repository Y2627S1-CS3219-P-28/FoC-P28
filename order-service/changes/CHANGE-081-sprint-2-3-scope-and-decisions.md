# CHANGE-081: Vincent's Sprint 2-3 scope and pending lifecycle design

- Date: 2026-10-08 (Asia/Singapore)
- Developer/approver: Vincent; identity and Order-owned scope explicitly confirmed.
- Branch: `sprint-2-3`.
- Status: Partial approval recorded; implementation pending unresolved choices.
- Classification: Scope transition and approved architecture/specification amendments.

## Sources and inspection

The user selected `Order Service Overall Doc.pdf` alongside Project D1, both at
the same directory level as FOC. The overall document contains sequences 1-12,
including abort/reopen/expiry, administration/holds and automatic/manual reposting.
Relevant sequence/class diagram images were visually inspected. This source is
not the missing previously recorded `Order Service Overall Doc - Updated.pdf`;
old approved ADRs remain relevant unless explicitly superseded by current approval.

- Overall PDF SHA256: `F0E925278FCCC0FCBB48F6C7BE1C23D908E15BEF75BB7C013EEC28C3F05DA602`.
- D1 SHA256: `C7381CB03CE40E64FAA1B1E9856CC99D13BF9295BA3159481C63A4AF42BFB5AC`.

Related requirements: Order F3/F5 acceptance authorization; F4.1.6/F7 completion;
F4.1.7-F4.1.11, F10/F11 cancellation/expiry/abort/reopening; F8/F9 current/history;
NTH2 User-owned penalties; NTH4 reposting. Exact scope/test mapping remains to be
completed before implementation; no requirement is marked verified by this record.

## Confirmed decisions (approved, not applied)

1. Vincent owns this branch's Order-side work. Peers remain read-only; their
   implementation/integration will be added and independently verified later.
2. Acceptance must wait for synchronous Credit courier-assignment confirmation.
   The existing proposed `PUT /api/credits/orders/{orderId}/courier-assignment`
   body `{"courierId":"..."}` may be mocked locally because the peer route is
   absent. This is a renewed contract-stub exception, not proof of a live account.
3. One current Order plus immutable courier-attempt history was explicitly
   selected. The user additionally requested a database UUID primary key distinct
   from business orderId. Detailed migration/key/reference design remains pending.
4. Only the assigned courier may abort an ACCEPTED task before IN_PROGRESS.
   Preserve the aborted attempt; requester sees OPEN before original expiry or
   EXPIRED at/after expiry, not an active ABORTED order.
5. Every abort publishes the accepted-cancellation fact for User penalties.
   An expired outcome additionally publishes the refund fact for Credit;
   before-expiry reopening does not publish a Credit refund/abort event.
6. Requester cancellation and expiry use the existing refund topic/outbox.
   Normal/automatic completion uses the existing completion event/outbox.
7. Reposting must create a new business orderId and reserve new credits before
   OPEN. The user requested removing/replacing the expired original, but has
   subsequently asked about overwriting the row/ID; final retention/replacement
   mechanics are unresolved, not silently selected by AI.
8. The minute-based scheduler completes DELIVERED tasks only after at least
   48 hours, using the normal completion workflow. It exists already; correctness
   and production scheduling availability still require verification.
9. Follow-up approval: abort must synchronously update Credit's courier assignment;
   do not rely on a later acceptance blindly overwriting the previous courier.
   The exact reset value, endpoint and stale-retry protection remain unapproved.
10. Follow-up clarification: abort after expiry keeps the current business orderId
    and changes its current state to EXPIRED, with a separate immutable ABORTED
    attempt for the aborting courier. This does not authorize duplicate live orders.

Items 3-5 supersede conflicting historical Sprint 1 policy in principle;
application, contracts, diagram/data design and tests are not synchronized yet.

## Unresolved decisions and risks

- Synchronous Credit update on abort is now approved in principle. Confirm whether
  this clears courierId to null, retains the reservation, and uses the existing
  proposed hold-for-reopen route or a revised assignment contract. FEEDBACK-004's
  assignment contract does not establish null/reset or guarded overwrite support.
  A delayed retry must not clear/replace a newer courier. Peer routes remain missing.
- Abort-to-EXPIRED with the SAME ID is now explicitly confirmed. Repost still
  creates a NEW business ID; replacing/removing its original current row remains
  pending. Publication confirmation is not confirmation of a completed refund.
  Pub/Sub retention/dead-letter behavior means retry is not an infinite business
  guarantee. Retain the old ID and self-contained refund payload in durable records
  and preserve courier history; failed reservation must leave the original intact.
- V2 currently gives order_event_outbox.order_id a foreign key to orders(id);
  checkpoints also reference that key. Literal row deletion or ID replacement is
  not currently supported and requires an explicitly reviewed new migration.
  Historical references must not be changed to the repost's new business ID.
- No allocation or user approval authorizes edits to Credit/User/Supplier/Admin.
- Actual consumers, trusted lifecycle authentication and Cloud Run cron behavior
  remain separate production gates. No automatic HTTP-to-mock fallback is approved.

## Changes and verification

Only workflow/approval records and the local profile are updated. The local
profile is currently tracked in Git despite historical instructions describing
it as ignored; no ignore/untrack operation is performed by this change. No
application source, tests, migrations, event schemas, API implementations,
frontend, Compose or infrastructure files are changed. A follow-up learning note
in the ignored learning/refund-events-and-order-history.md explains publication
versus refund completion and the current foreign-key constraint; it is not committed.
TOML parsing,
explicit pending-decision assertions, unique evolution ID, change-record existence
and `git diff --check` passed. No runtime tests are claimed.

## Next implementation gate

Resolve the two choices above; complete the detailed feature proposal and affected
contract/diagram/data/test chain; use a new Flyway migration (never edit V1/V2);
observe failing tests before code; verify clean and upgrade database paths,
authorization, repeated courier attempts, race boundaries, idempotency, outbox
delivery/retries, UI isolation and the 48-hour threshold. Keep Sprint 2-3 incomplete
until its applicable completion gates pass.
